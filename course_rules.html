        <p><b>Object of the Game -</b> -Disc golf is played similarly to tradiational golf. The object of the game is to have the 
            lowest score. Each time you throw the disc it counts as a stroke. There are also penalty strokes that are descriped below.
            Instead of  a hole, you will be trying to get your disk to land in a basket (pictured below). Hitting the chains above the 
            is usually sevice to get the disc in the basket.
        </p>

        <p><b>Respect other players -</b> Disc golf is meant as recreation, and as such Huck It encourages all
            players to have a good time while on the course. Huck It also asks that players show respect towards other players on the course and 
            to not let your good time impede others. Let faster players play ahead of you. Don't shoot blindly into areas until when there is a 
            party ahead of you check that there out of range.
        </p>


        <p><b>Respect the Course and the Environment -</b> Please place all trash in provided garbage cans. Please avoid walking in muddy areas
            after heavy rain falls.
        </p>   
            
            
        <p><b>Tee-Off -</b>Tee throws must be completed within or begind the desifnated tee area. The player with the lowest score on the 
            previous hole shoots first. In the event of a tie, follow the same order as the previous hole.
        </p>

        <p><b>Order of play -</b> After tee off the playest furthest from the basket shoots first</p>

        <p><b>Run-ups and Follow Throughs -</b>A player may build up momentum by running before releasing throwing their disc. The disc 
          must be released before the landing spot of the previous shot. A marker disc may be placed to ensure disc is released in time. 
          You can also follow through past the landing point of your disc after your release
        </p>

        <p><b>Putting -</b> Within 10 yards of the basket, a player may not step past the point of his or her lie while putting. In other words,
        no follow through is permitted. Falling or jumping is not permitted</p>

        <p><b>Completion of a hole -</b> The disc must come to rest inside, not on top, of the basket for the hole to be complete.</p>

        <p><b>Lost Discs</b> Lost Discs are assessed one penalty stroke, with the next stroke taken from the previous lie (the penalty
           stroke is optional if playing casually). You are welcome to search as long as you want for your disc, but me mindful of parties 
           you. Limit your search to 3 minutes if there is a party behind you, or let them play through.
        </p>

        <p><b>Disc caught in above the playing surface -</b> Discs caught in trees or other objects that keep them off the ground will be
            placed on the ground directely below where they are caught.No penalty stroke will be marked.
        
        </p>

        <p><b>Out of Bounds and Penalty Strokes -</b> Permanent water (not puddles after heavy rain), argicultural fields, and marked areas
            will be considered out of bounds. A player who shoots a disc out of bound will receive a penalty stroke (optional
            in casual play). The player may take the next shot from: (1) The previous lie; or (2) A lie that is up to three feer away from 
            perpendicular to the point where the disc goes out of bounds.
        </p>
