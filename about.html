            <h1>The Story of Huck It</h1>
            </div>
            
            <div class= "w3-container w3-white">
    
            <p>Huck It was built and designed by Charles McCardle on his family farm's woodlot from 2014-2018. Through many long hours of 
                turmoil and sweat Charles turned his dream into a reality.Friends and family from  around the community also helped,
                contributing sponsorships, labour, and expertise during the construction of Huck It. Huck It extends its gratitude to 
                all of them.
            </p>
                
            
            <p>  Peter Piper from the Canadian National Disc Association also was a major supporter of Huck It. Piper dropped in to visit 
                 Huck It while the course was still under construction, and immediately saw the potiental. Impressed by the course and the 
                 work that Charles largely completed on his own, Piper offered Huck It the opportunity to be a part of the 2018 Canadian 
                 National Disc Golf Championship, which just so happened to be taking place Sept. 14-20 in PEI. Huck It wasn't scheduled to be
                 completed until the Fall of 2019, but  it was hard to turn down the opportunity to host some of the 2018 Canadian National
                 Disc Golf Championship. 
            </p> 
            
            <p> Not wanting to waste such a great opportunity, Peter and Charles began working together to ensure Huck It would be ready in
                time. Peter experience and financial support, combined with Charles's tireless work ethic ensured that Huck It got completed by
                 September, just in time for the 2018 National Disc Golf Championship!! 
                 Huck It extends a warm thank you to Peter for all of your support!!            </p>
